# Product/Service Analysis Methodology

## Vue d'Ensemble

Cette méthodologie en 7 étapes permet d'analyser en profondeur n'importe quel **produit physique** ou **service** pour identifier les desires, construire des avatars précis, et créer des ads gagnantes.

---

## Distinction Fondamentale : Produits vs Services

### PRODUITS (Objets Physiques)

**Caractéristiques** :
- Features tangibles (matériaux, dimensions, technologie)
- Bénéfices immédiats et visibles
- Démonstration via photos/vidéos produit
- Social proof sur qualité physique
- USP = technologie, matériaux, design

**Exemples** : Dog Harness, Blinds, Collagen, Electronics

### SERVICES (Actions, Expériences)

**Caractéristiques** :
- Features = processus, méthodes, durée, livrables
- Bénéfices souvent intangibles et différés
- Démonstration via témoignages, before/after
- Social proof sur expérience/résultats
- USP = expertise, approche unique, méthodologie

**Exemples** : Webinaire coaching, VTC transport, Formation, Consulting

## Méthodologie en 7 Étapes

### ÉTAPE 1 : BASICS

#### Pour PRODUITS
```
Product Name: [Nom]
Price Point: [Prix] [Promo si applicable]
```

**Exemple** :
```
Product Name: Dog Harness
Price Point: $52.00 $42.00
```

#### Pour SERVICES
```
Service Name: [Nom]
Price Point: [Prix/durée] (ex: /heure, /session, /mois)
Duration: [Durée]
Format: [Format de livraison]
```

**Exemple** :
```
Service Name: Webinaire Syndrome de l'Imposteur
Price Point: Gratuit (lead magnet pour coaching $200/session)
Duration: 60 minutes
Format: Live Zoom + Replay 7 jours
```

---

### ÉTAPE 2 : PRODUCT/SERVICE IN ACTION

**Question centrale** : HOW does your product/service work?

**Livrer 2 versions** :
1. Version complète (niveau adulte)
2. Version 6th-grade (simplicité maximale)

#### Pour PRODUITS
Focus sur le **processus physique/mécanique**.

**Exemple (Dog Harness)** :
```
Full Version:
The harness wraps around the dog's chest with an ITW military-grade buckle that secures in 2-3 seconds, distributing pull pressure across the chest rather than the neck, with adjustable straps for perfect fit and a front D-ring to redirect pulling behavior.

6th-Grade Version:
The harness wraps around your dog's chest and back. This spreads out the pull when your dog walks, so it doesn't hurt their neck like a collar does. You can put it on super fast - just 2-3 seconds!
```

#### Pour SERVICES
Focus sur le **déroulement + transformation**.

**Exemple (Webinaire Coaching)** :
```
Full Version:
The webinar guides participants through a 60-minute structured experience where they first identify their imposter syndrome patterns via interactive exercises, then learn the PNL reframing technique to transform limiting beliefs, and finally receive a personalized action plan to implement immediately.

6th-Grade Version:
In this online class, you'll figure out why you feel like a fraud even when you're doing well. Then you'll learn a special way to change how you think about yourself. By the end, you'll have a simple plan to feel more confident starting today.

### ÉTAPE 7 : HIDDEN MECHANISMS

**But** : Découvrir ce que TU ne vois pas comme vendeur.

#### Les 4 Questions Magiques

**QUESTION 1 : What does your product/service do that you DON'T advertise?**

*Produit (Dog Harness)* :
- ITW Military-Grade Buckle (critical safety feature but buried in specs)
- Material prevents matting of dog's fur

*Service (Webinaire)* :
- Creates accountability through community
- Provides vocabulary to explain feelings to others
- Acts as filter for high-quality coaching clients

**QUESTION 2 : What ingredients/components/methods do you include that competitors don't?**

*Produit* :
- Specific buckle brand (ITW - not generic plastic)
- Name tag customization (competitors charge extra)

*Service* :
- Specific PNL technique (not generic "mindset coaching")
- 7-day replay (competitors only give 24h or charge extra)
- Follow-up email series (competitors stop at webinar)

**QUESTION 3 : If your product/service worked TOO well, what would customers "complain" about?**

*Produit* :
- "Dog walks are so boring now, he never pulls anymore"
- "I can't have a quick walk - every dog owner wants to know where I got it"
- "My dog is so comfortable he doesn't want to take it off"

*Service* :
- "I'm too confident now, people at work think I'm arrogant"
- "I have too many opportunities, I don't know which to choose"
- "I spoke up so much in meetings they made me lead the project"

**QUESTION 4 : If someone was explaining this to their friend, what would they ACTUALLY say?**

*Produit* :
```
"Oh, that harness? Yeah, it's actually pretty good.

I got it because Jake's old one broke - the plastic buckle just snapped one day when he lunged. This one has some heavy-duty buckle that's supposed to be unbreakable or whatever.

The thing I actually like about it is how fast it goes on. You know how Jake used to hate getting his harness on and would try to back away? This one just clips on super quick, so there's less drama.

And it has his name on it, which is kind of nice. I was always worried about losing those little ID tags that jingle around.

But honestly, the biggest difference is he doesn't pull as much anymore. The leash clips to the front instead of his back, so when he tries to pull forward, it just kind of redirects him.

It's held up pretty well too. I think I've had it for like eight months? No issues so far.

Why, is Buddy giving you trouble on walks? Yeah, you might want to try something like this."
```

*Service* :
```
"I did this webinar thing last week about imposter syndrome. At first I was like 'another self-help thing,' but it was actually really practical.

The coach had us do this exercise where you reframe how you think about your accomplishments. Like, instead of 'I got lucky,' you say 'I created that opportunity through X, Y, Z.' I don't know, it just clicked for me.

I've been using it all week and I actually spoke up in that big meeting yesterday. You know, the one I was dreading? Yeah, I presented my idea and everyone was nodding. It was wild.

There's also like a community thing where people share their wins. It's kind of motivating to see other people dealing with the same stuff.

If you're interested, I think they do it monthly. Let me know, I can send you the link."
```

## Conseils d'Application

### Pour les PRODUITS
- ✅ Focus sur tangible, mesurable, visible
- ✅ Photos/vidéos du produit en action
- ✅ Spécifications techniques comme USPs
- ✅ Before/after de l'environnement (ex: pièce sombre → lumineuse)

### Pour les SERVICES
- ✅ Focus sur transformation, expérience, résultats
- ✅ Témoignages clients comme preuve principale
- ✅ Méthodologie/approche comme USPs
- ✅ Before/after émotionnel/situationnel

### Erreurs à Éviter
- ❌ Traiter un service comme un produit (focus features vs transformation)
- ❌ Traiter un produit comme un service (trop vague sur specs)
- ❌ Sauter l'étape Hidden Mechanisms (c'est là qu'est l'or)
- ❌ Ne pas connecter Benefits → Desires → Émotions
